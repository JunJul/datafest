DataFest 2024


I was doing this project in a Hackthon called DataFest. The DataFest is held at UCLA, and the dataset was given by a learning platform called CourseKata which teaches students how to learn statistics. The main topic of this Hackthon was to find insights into how to improve students' engagement.

In my opinion, our team should look into the response dataset which has all the responses to each question from each student, according to this idea, I looked into the response dataset and found out there were a lot of students cannot get the points from some specific type of questions. To gain more insight, I tried to merge the response, item, and page views dataset to find out what type of question students struggle with most and why they only try once or twice to attempt these questions.

My team job was to merge datasets, so the merged dataset could help my teammates do more analysis.

Due to the policy of the DataFest, I cannot show any information about the datasets from CourseKata, so only the codes are shown in this notebook.
